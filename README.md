# ElectricityDemandML

This repository contains a time series analysis project focused on forecasting electricity demand for a leading electricity distribution company. The goal of this project is to accurately estimate electricity demand for the next 1-2 years to facilitate efficient production and vendor management.

Business Context:

Understanding electricity demand is crucial for managing production and procurement effectively. The availability of historical monthly electricity consumption data from January 1973 to December 2019 provides an opportunity to forecast future demand accurately.

Business Objective:

a. Forecast Electricity Demand: Predict electricity demand for the next 1-2 years based on historical consumption data.

b. Error Metrics Calculation: Calculate error metrics such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Root Mean Square Percentage Error (RMSPE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) to evaluate the accuracy of the forecasting models.

c. Model Comparison: Compare various time series forecasting models, including Decomposition, ETS (Error, Trend, Seasonality) models, and ARIMA/SARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average/Seasonal ARIMA) models with different parameters to identify the most suitable model.

Available Data:

The dataset includes monthly electricity consumption data from January 1973 to December 2019, with the following columns:

Date: Month and Year
Electricity Consumption: Electricity consumption in Trillion Watts
Expected Outputs:

a. Detailed Code: The repository includes detailed code with proper comments for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

b. Model Validation Metrics: Provide accuracy metrics such as RMSE, RMSPE, and MAPE to validate the forecasting models.

c. Demand Estimation: Provide demand estimation for the next 1-2 years on a monthly basis using the selected forecasting model.

d. Model Selection: Clearly state the selected forecasting model and provide reasons for its selection based on performance metrics and other considerations.
